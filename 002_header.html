		<h1> The lost map </h1>
		<p> In the quiet town of Elmsbury, 14 years old tobi stumbled across a dusty old box in his grandmother's attic.inside, he found a crumbling leather map marked with strange symbols and the words 'to the treasure beneath the wind'. His heart raced. was this a clue to something real, or just an old family legend. </p>
		
		
		<h2> The forbidden forest </h2>
		<p> Despite his grandmother's warning to leave his past alone, Tobi followed the map to the edge of the forbidden forest. whispers of strange lights and shadows in those woods had kept even the bravest townsfolk away for decades armed with a flashlight, a bottle of water, and his loyal dog miko, tobi stepped into the unknown. </p>
	
		
		<h3> The stranger in the trees </h3>
		<p> As twilight settled over the forest, Tobi heard soft footsteps that weren't his own. from behind a tree stepped a girl about his age with messy curls and a compass around her neck. her name was amara. She had also found a map, half a map. Together, they realized their pieces fit perfectly. </p>
		

		<h4> The underground door </h4>
		<p> Following the combined map, they reached a hallow tree with a carved wind symbol. Beneath it's roots was a trapdoor. It creaked open to reveal stone stairs spiralling into darkness. The air below smelled of moss and secrets. Tobi hesitated, but amara's confident nod pushed him forward. </p>
		

		<h5> The room of echoes </h5>
		<p> They emerged into a stone chamber glowing wind ancient symbols. In the center sat a chest surrounded by wind chimes that rang without a breeze. when they touched the chest, echoes of voices filled the room, stories of explorers, of dreams, of a hidden world meant for those brave enough to find it. </p>
		
		<h6> The real treasure </h6>
		<p> Inside the chest wasn't gold or jewels but a journal, a telescope, and a key. A note read: 'The true treasure is the path you choose and the people you meet.' Disapointed at first, Tobi and Amara soon understood. That adventure sparked something in them, a thirst for discovery,and a friendship they would never forget. </p>
